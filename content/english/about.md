Hello, I'm Lisa. A thirty-something year old on an IVF journey. Passionate about removing the stigma of infertility and supporting others who find themselves in a similar position.

> [1 in 6](https://www.who.int/news/item/04-04-2023-1-in-6-people-globally-affected-by-infertility "www.who.org") people globally struggle to concieve, a whopping 17.5% of the adult population!...yet solutions for preventions, diagnosis and treatment remain underfunded and inaccessible.

Four years into the journey, I have learned many things that I believe will be valuable to others. The hope is that the words, tips, and research in this blog help you navigate the path to motherhood. Most importantly, I hope it helps you feel less alone xx
