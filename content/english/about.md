Hello, I'm Lisa. A thirty-something year old on an IVF journey. Sharing all the learnings. Passionate about removing the stigma of infertility.

> 1 in 6 people globally struggle to concieve, a whopping 17.5% of the adult population...yet solutions for preventions, diagnosis and treatment remain underfunded and inaccessible.

4 years into the journey, I have learnt many things that I believe will be valuable to others on a similar path. Thanks for reading - I hope my words help you feel less alone xx
