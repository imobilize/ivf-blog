Going through IVF is taxing on the body. If you’re anything like me, you won’t have realised just how much weight you can gain and how difficult it can be to lose it once on. Fear not! After being through several cycles, I’ve discovered the most effective ways to manage IVF weight gain.<br />   
You are going to learn my tried and tested, non-invasive, gentle methods to manage and cope with the physical changes you may see in your body while going through treatment.<br />   
After learning about these IVF weight gain management tips, you are going to be prepared to take proactive steps to minimise this unwanted side effect and honestly, who doesn’t need one less thing to worry when going through fertility issues?<br />   
<span style="font-size:10.8em;"><div align="center">**This post is all about IVF weight gain.**</div></span><br />   
IVF weight gain is real! Well for me anyways. Personally I was 7lbs heavier by the end of my first cycle! I have always had a healthy BMI and fortunately never struggled with my weight prior to treatment so you can imagine this was a shock and a side effect that I was definitely not prepared for. I knew that if we were going to go on to do more cycles, I would have to find ways to navigate this.<br />   
I know not all women do experience it but most warriors I’ve spoken to in my clinic shared that they did gain during the process. If your search has brought you here, then I’m almost certain you’re experiencing it too. So why does it happen and what can you do about it?

## Most common contributing factors to IVF weight gain

**Hormones**

We all know the power of our hormones from the fluctuations we see in our body (and mood) during a regular monthly cycle. From the onset of puberty we are aware of this. Of course with IVF, the levels of certain circulating hormones increase.<br />   
Rises and fluctuations in certain hormones like progesterone increase appetite and therefore the chances of reaching for extra food is elevated. On top of that, these hormonal changes can slow down your metabolism and as a direct result of ongoing stimulation the ovaries may become swollen (depending on the amount of follicles that grow) causing weight gain.<br />   
**Stress**
Cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone is no doubt in play when going through IVF. Infertility can go on for years even before we turn to assisted methods. I’ve found, in hindsight, that even if I didn’t consciously feel stressed, on a subconscious level there definitely was a stress party happening inside my body. When this happens, cortisol floods the body and among other things can promote weight gain particularly around the middle.<br />   
**Lifestyle changes**

On some cycles I have been advised by the medical team to reduce physical activities such as running and other cardio exercises. This obviously leads to a decrease in calorie burn (unless you increase gentle exercising like walking), and a reduction in feel-good endorphins. With time this may lead to the brain seeking to achieve the buzz that you once got from a workout from alternative means like food to boost your mood.<br />   
Witnessing these changes in your body during IVF can be somewhat disheartening. The good news is that there are definitely healthy, non-invasive ways to manage these shifts and to ensure that any weight gain is minimal and temporary.<br />   

## Is it fluid retention, bloating or excess fat?

The first thing you can do is decipher if what you are seeing and feeling is the result of fluid retention, bloating or weight gain caused by excess fat. While fluid retention and bloating can contribute to temporary gains and change your shape, they are not the same as the body storing additional fat.<br />   
By far the changes I was most aware of were due to my body retaining water. A puffy face and cellulite type pattern on my inner upper arms and thighs were the tell-tale signs. Fluid retention typically peaks at the end of the IVF cycle and reduces on cessation of stimulation injections. The hormones are excreted into the urine and the symptoms dissipate. Personally I found water retention to be what I struggled with most during my first treatment cycle as my limbs generally felt more solid and I felt less light on my feet than usual.<br />   
Weight gain as a result of bloating tends to show up suddenly, over night or even in the space of an afternoon and like fluid retention, is typically temporary. While fluid retention is more commonly witnessed in the limbs, bloating is characterised by a swollen tummy that is hard to touch and can in some instances cause discomfort.<br />   
What stages is bloating most likely?<br />   
Bloating following ovarian stimulation is common. In the beginning, it may be so minimal that you don’t really notice.  In my experience, bloating started about 5 days into taking the stimulation injections. It is also common in the period between egg retrieval and fresh embryo transfer.<br />   
Weight gain due to excess fat, on the other hand, shows up on the scale in a gradual manner. Most commonly it accumulates around the mid section, feels squidgy (as opposed to bloat, which is hard to the touch) and takes longer to reduce.<br />   
There are different ways to manage these types of weight gain. The most effective non-diet related ways that I have found are outlined below. I have personally tried and tested each of these and can confidently say they helped me greatly during my treatment.<br />   

## Tried and tested ways to manage these side effects

**For fluid retention**

1. [Electrolytes to reduce fluid retention](https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-I-V-Hydration-Multiplier-Single-Serving/dp/B0BQ51S5BL?crid=1011W3WNH4VII&keywords=liquid+iv&qid=1707126774&sprefix=liquid+,aps,402&sr=8-2&linkCode=sl1&tag=ivfjourney-20&linkId=235512f0797c2e3f1e08ec7ac4d9e1d3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

Stay hydrated! It seems counter intuitive that if the body is retaining water to add more but this really is the remedy! Drinking plenty of water can help excrete excess fluids from your body but I have found that adding electrolytes reduces fluid retention faster than increasing water intake alone. These ones are my go to, they come individually wrapped and the strawberry lemonade flavour tastes great.<br />   
2. [Lymphatic drainage to drastically improve bumpy skin](https://www.amazon.com/DAOZWUBGIH-Lymphatic-Drainage-Cellulite-Massager/dp/B0BMQHGMM2) texture due to fluid retention

This massage roller is genuinely the bee’s knees and it is one tool I would not be without in combatting fluid retention. 5 minutes rolling and the appearance of skin is smoother - just make sure to massage in the direction of your lymph nodes to encourage the excess fluid to move outward.<br />   
**For bloating**

3. Apply a heat pack to reduce the discomfort of bloating

Heat can work wonders for bloating. The heat relaxes the outer stomach muscles and promotes smooth digestion. I have [this amazing heat wrap](https://www.amazon.com/Microwavable-Extra-Large-Heating-Lower/dp/B07S2NCM7W/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=21HF2YDD6300X&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.D51qAfMFjNBNttu36wn-A9AcE-0sh5YwR7XnSQvjpAc0KMov1pZlUA8K5YmqeRsrvMM7YYjEWaqJtILkpmKxQnkDrbuao5ntQ-c59OpnN0hkx-uDH8jW88t12nTaY8E-PWpKwhciT45dHXvXPRu6uh3uccn_zaLFaA5C6ZqsAM1SSEvAlyaL20ehInBUAaxv1gjpfLxftsS67YQ5ec-bu6tr9T0nH7UwPXYmVSCSYpDtxUoYK3bKfJ1QgIUyoS860FiZLMcDMgXox9R8gaT0JGkx4c5ic7LJ1HG9xwyd1i4.vHfLkZ4_70lru_TQcOGo0jaGILWY7hXUZbVL7qpLXkE&dib_tag=se&keywords=heat+packs+for+pain+relief&qid=1711911491&sprefix=heat+pacl,aps,156&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1), it's microwaveable, holds the heat, is well made and unlike others I’ve had in the past, does not have a strong odour. It’s so good that I’ve bought it as a gift for several of my friends.…yes I am that invested in the power of heat to soothe. <br />   
**For weight gain due to increased fat storage**

4. [Get enough quality sleep with the lumie sleep clock](https://www.amazon.com/Lumie-Bodyclock-Shine-300-Wake-up/dp/B082VB97H9/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2J73M5I1RDHPZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HRgHsY62ngDZ2KEvgXjAogc9FF_F8-1dPAGjPVUfJ2ocnYuBM40Z4iJCZabJu_3Q0YhElL7ljiypQWTX0Fyu_3b7aNNULSr5DvVyHV3CB5H3HtVq0qa-3HwqV1-wpJvJ5u-wRp38CbJEAY6kgkmm-4oOPpnjMXXlgB9ArMAlbSSgq49pI90h7Zmb28oXAOuAwBflaPrSPt0YHKody-ewODtu9iJkp0xR5q65W2OuHUWjssWoRze3aPzqTk0CQOeW.B3kW2as7a749ydb1eVulsy1YYld5yo8h9NCkxlVPmAA&dib_tag=se&keywords=lumie+bodyclock&qid=1711644373&refinements=p_72:1248915011&rnid=1248913011&s=home-garden&sprefix=lumi+body+clock,aps,153&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1#customerReviews)

Lack of quality sleep negatively impacts hormones that regulate appetite. I personally found that my sleep was impacted hugely by IVF. It was probably a combination of the treatment and anxiety and was something I really struggled with. Falling asleep was easy but staying asleep became a real problem. I did try so many natural remedies, tried increasing my exercise and only saw a real, marked change when I started using the sleep clock.<br />   
I invested in the lumie bodyclock 300 (and I say invested because it isn’t the cheapest) and I do not regret it. Not one bit. The difference in my sleep quality was immediate and the knock on effects were obvious. The less tired you are during the day, the less you reach for snacks.<br />   
Good quality sleep is the foundation for our general health and if I could only invest in a few items, I would pick this one over and over again.<br />   
5. Reduce stress by mindfully colouring 

Chronic stress (and let’s face it, who isn’t experiencing a prolonged stressful period when going through IVF) contributes to abdominal weight gain. The best way I have found to counteract this (in addition to quality sleep)?<br />   
Mindful colouring! <br />   
Yes, you read that correctly. Getting into the habit of just 10 - 15 minutes of mindful colouring made a noticeable difference to my stress levels. My favourite is [mindful colouring for women](https://www.amazon.com/RYVE-Adult-Coloring-Book-Women/dp/B09NB2GZTD/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=FQ7WU0NNDB5U&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xCkpvL1JNpk-ezUzFx8ifbaHlhSSPD9MNVjujrd4Z2mCznJCLL1typzZex7jvgtb7BCwfCdtUMrUOdx3z3kilTf33O2Kldwx7GHZ6k4gAl4rBQth4c7QdVj6Rtxkugre1BVmxEIr6EEADeq_YWfy_8-nLA8OafmPUDFQyymL4zNrJrZTWBF-RT16IDAZS9NOFgHBfIEbrGzhcZkRa0xBqmDYWaflg2AZNYEgA-qAq-CUl_2Nuo3OlurFj7_w4FTbFUC4dUoO3-0NoQxWiNMpNfz22_eUEGpCw_n1pQF5sso.1oKGCj02_m0POsOXuTCI3yMVOAP97PCDW5o3_eLdCOg&dib_tag=se&keywords=mindful+coloring+book+for+adults&qid=1711637368&sprefix=mindful+c,aps,154&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)<br />   
The drawings are beautiful, it has lovely inspirational quotes and best of all the pages are perforated you you can tear them out easily. I’ve framed a few of mine and they have made lovely additions to our home. Every time I look at them, I feel a sense of peace. Who wouldn’t want that?<br />   
There you have it, my tried and true ways to manage IVF weight gain. These have all been game changers for me and dare I say make going through multiple cycles more manageable. Let me know if you try any of the above and your thoughts.
