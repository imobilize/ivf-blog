Egg retrieval: a major step in your IVF journey! Like all the stages in the IVF process, it’s one filled with uncertainties, emotions and yearning for answers.<br />   
As someone who has walked this road several times (with varying outcomes), I want to share my insights with those of you who are thinking of going down the IVF route or have already started the process and are wondering what to expect. Think of it as having a friendly guide who’s been around the maze a few times!<br />   
In the interest of offering practical advice, this post is arranged into things you need to consider pre-egg retrieval, on the day of retrieval and post surgery.<br />

## How to prepare for IVF egg retrieval

In the weeks leading up to the egg retrieval, your body will become a battleground of hormones, injections, and doctor's appointments. It's like preparing for a marathon, but instead of running shoes, you'll be armed with needles and medication…<br />   
**Self-care**
I know, I know! People throw that term around willy nilly now but genuinely if ever there was a time to double down on caring for yourself it’s now….the time is now sis!<br />   
Self care is often sold to us as the physical things we can do for ourselves but just as important are those self care activities that nurture your mental and emotional wellbeing; it’s about preparing your whole self for the the journey ahead.<br />   
If you’ve read any of my other posts, you’ll know how much I advocate for journaling. It’s free (apart from the cost of some paper) and it’s deeply therapeutic when done regularly.<br />   
It’s also a place where you can write the details of your IVF protocol which brings me nicely to the practical aspects of the IVF journey.<br />   
My best advice? <br />   
Plan ahead like you’re organising a major event (and in the same way you might expect the best laid plans to deviate, expect that your journey may take you down different routes that even a solid plan cannot prepare you for)…..i.e. plan and then release any pre-conceptions of how it will play out to the will of the universe.<br />   
Your fridge will soon be stocked with vials of medications and your calendar will resemble a well-choreographed dance of appointments. Have a system in place - a planner - to keep track of medications, appointments and your feelings. Here’s the [planner](https://amzn.to/48syoK7) I am currently using.<br />   
**Injections**
The mere thought of self-administered shots may send shivers down your spine, but as we know, it's a temporary discomfort for a potentially life-changing outcome.<br />   
Get your partner involved; make it a team effort. You'll find that the act of injecting yourself becomes a symbol of your strength and determination.<br />   
**Your team**
In the midst of it all, don't forget to communicate openly with your healthcare team. Ask questions, express your concerns, and lean on their expertise. They're not just there to perform medical procedures; they're your partners in this journey. Understanding the process and feeling heard will empower you to face each step with confidence.<br />   
The importance of trusting your healthcare team cannot be overstated. We have met many consultants, embryologists, nurses and surgeons along our multiple IVF journeys. Unfortunately there have been times when the levels of compassion shown by the team have left us mildly devastated to the point where we’ve changed clinics (that’s a story for a different post!)<br />   
On the flip side, I can still see, in my minds eye, the wonderful consultants and nurses we have met, who have shown compassion and demonstrated respect all while remaining professional. It’s that humanity that really makes a difference to the clinicalness of it all.<br />   
While we may all have differing medical presentations, we are all united by the fact that we have had to take the non-traditional route to growing our families.<br />   
You know that age old adage - a problem shared is a problem halved? Well….here’s a new one - an IVF journey shared with a fellow IVF warrior is akin to applying soothing balm to your soul. Catchy right?!<br />   
The road to egg retrieval may be challenging, but the destination holds the promise of new beginnings. Embrace the process, lean on your support system, and let the spirit of trust guide you.<br />   
## IVF egg retrieval day

Egg retrieval day, a date circled on the calendar with a mix of anticipation and nerves. As I reflect on my own experience, there's a well of emotions bubbling beneath the surface – excitement, anxiety, hope, and a good dose of vulnerability. If you're standing on the precipice of this crucial day, let me share a glimpse into what you might expect.<br />   
The morning of the egg retrieval is a symphony of emotions. You'll likely wake up early, your mind racing with thoughts about the day ahead. Take a moment to breathe; remind yourself of the resilience that has brought you to this point. Today is a milestone, a step closer to the possibility of new life.<br />   
At this point you’re likely wondering is egg retrieval painful?<br />   
Of course everyone is different but personally, I have never felt pain before, during or immediately after the procedure.<br />   
**Egg retrieval procedure**  
Before the procedure, you'll have a chance to connect with your healthcare team. It's a moment for questions, for expressing any lingering concerns, and for soaking in the knowledge that you're in capable hands.<br />   
The nurses will then weigh you, take your temperature, pulse and blood pressure and ask you to confirm when you last consumed food and liquids.<br />   
Before long you will be wheeled into the operating room. The first step is a scan to check the follicles size and position. Once the surgeon confirms that all is in order, the surgical team begins the best choreographed dance you will ever witness!<br />  
Honestly, I was blown away by how the team worked together during these surgeries. While one nurse was adjusting my pillow, another was hooking me up to a monitor, the embryologist was simultaneously asking me to confirm my name and date of birth while the anaesthetist was tapping on my hand to find a vein. I’ve never had so many hands laid on me at once and I found this part of the process deeply comforting and soothing.<br />   
At some point the anaesthetist begins to ask you questions. The first time I distinctly remember being asked where my favourite place was. He talked with me a little bit about it while he continued to tap on my hand encouraging the vein to become more prominent. As we continued to talk, he injected the anaesthetic. I felt it running through my hand and into my arm and milliseconds later I was out cold.<br />   
Not sure if this is weird….but I genuinely really enjoyed this feeling! And this was totally unexpected!<br />   
The length of the egg retrieval procedure depends on how many follicles there are and their position in the ovaries. Generally the whole surgical operation can range from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Once over, the nurses wheel you back into the recovery room.<br />   
If you’re doing this with your male partner, now is the time for him to do his bit and provide a sample. He’ll be whisked off to a room to do the deed with the cup while you lie in a post anaesthetic haze looking down at your surgical gown and marvelling over your unpolished toenails (no make-up, deodorant or nail varnish is allowed).<br />   
During the next 30 minutes to one hour, the nurses return periodically to check your vitals and offer drinks. The embryologist comes to the room once your partner has returned and confirms how many eggs (if any) have been retrieved and outlines the next steps and touch points.<br />   
The next steps are very much dependent on whether you will move forward with a fresh embryo transfer or choose to freeze the embryo. If the former, you will be given medication to prepare your uterus.<br />   
You must pass urine before without blood before you are allowed to leave. This is to ensure that no damage has been done during the surgery.<br />   
And then you get dressed, lean on your partner and make your way home to start the recovery process.<br />   
## IVF egg retrieval recovery

Post-retrieval, rest becomes your ally. Again it’s a time to be gentle with yourself, to acknowledge what your body has just undergone.<br />   
You may be wondering if you should take time off work after egg retrieval. My healthcare teams have always advised not to work on the day of surgery. I have always come straight home, had something to eat and spent the rest of day in bed.<br />  
Physically, you may experience a range of sensations – from bloating and tenderness to the gentle pull of post-procedural discomfort. It's crucial to listen to your body and grant it the time and space it requires to heal - think cozy pjs, weighted blankets, and other [IVF Essentials](https://ivf-journey.com/ivf-essentials/)<br />   
In the days that follow, you may experience a whirlwind of emotions. The waiting game begins, but it's a wait filled with hope. Remember, recovery is not just physical; it's an emotional and psychological recalibration.<br />   
Allow yourself the grace to process the highs and lows. You’ve got this!<br />
